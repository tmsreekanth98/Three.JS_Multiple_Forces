# Three.JS_Multiple_Forces

Interactive Activity describing the effects of multiple forces on a block of fixed weight.
This project has been made using THREE.JS with the help of PIE Library.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
PIE Library must be included for the animation to work.
The index.html file will search for PIE as in "../PIE" so the folders should be arranged similarly such that the repository files find the PIE library files.
